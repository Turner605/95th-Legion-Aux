INSTALLATION NOTES
==================

Requirements: You need to have Arma 3 and two addons: CUP Terrains Core in order to play this map. Make sure you're using the latest official stable patch.
Without CUP Terrains Core the Fapovo Island would weight at least few GB. Use them as many other mods and terrains use it, too. They feature all A1/A2 buildings and other assets!

Client (Player)
===============
Required addons: CUP Terrains Core

1. Unpack folder @fapovo to your ArmA3 root folder. Be sure to have \addons\ folder structure present after the unpack procedure with all *.pbo's inside.

Then you have two options:
a) run game and under Expansions menu enable folders:
- @fapovo (IceBreakr's Fapovo x.xx)
- @cup_terrains_core 
Click OK and restart game.

b) or just run game with parameter: -mod=@fapovo;@cup_terrains_core
 
Island will then appear in map list and is ready for use. If you are using more mods, separate them with ; sign.

Dedicated server
================
Admins can grab server keys if they are running a signed server. See folder \keys in the archive.

Very IMPORTANT notes:
=========================
-> Be sure to delete any previous versions prior to the installation! If the island is not working properly, check other mod folders for duplicate pbos and bisign files.

IMPORTANT: See readme_fapovo.txt for license to use and other/full info!
