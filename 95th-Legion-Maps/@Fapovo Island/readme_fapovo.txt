1. INTRODUCTION
===============
Fapovo is a hommage map to OFP and Arma first series. Hopefully new players will appriciate it as the old fans.

2. AUTHOR
=========
IceBreakr is from Slovenia (Europe) and he's been a level designer for other games/simulations for more than 10 years now. Right after the release of Czech version of ArmA: Armed Assault, game soon became his passion and he formed a strong Slovenian community of mil-sim gamers supporting him in organizing and creating multiplayer coop/PvP events. Lack of islands made him switch to ArmA/ArmA 2 map making. Story continues in Arma 3.

3. WHAT IS FAPOVO?
====================
It's a federal republic consisting of Botana (Northeast part that is a Province of Sahrani and under Royal Sahrani jurisdiction) and Fapovo (south region). Recent conflicts between these two have caused both governments to set up border checkpoints again as they were decades ago. Some say country might split back in two.
Otherwise it's a small island with undeveloped tourism, so you can mainly enjoy the calm nature and enjoy the wind breeze from the sea.

4. CHANGELOG
============
For a complete list of changes see changelog.txt supplied in the archive. Includes history from first version in previous game engines.

5. FANTASY STORY TO GO ALONG WITH THE NEW ARMA ISLAND?
====================
I got inspired for this project by an old Red Dawn movie from 1984 (see http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087985/). There are numerous locations that can be used to recreate the scenes from the movie. Farms, gas stations, couple of small towns, roads leading up to the woods, etc. Map is intended for small scale warfare, infantry scenarios with limited air & armor support.

A chemical experiment went bad on NW and a large sector vegetation dried up and soil became poisoned. It took 20 years to resettle people there, but old village where accident happened is still deserted, people are only allowed to drive through with windows closed.

6. INTERESTING FACTS
====================
Try to find Dongo the Dog - its really an impressive statue ;)

7. INSTALLATION
===============
Warning: In order for this island to work you need a special package CUP Terrains Core (@cup_terrains_core) that includes legacy objects from previous Arma games!

Unpack folder \@fapovo to your ArmA3 root Steam folder and run game with -mod=@fapovo  parameter. Island will appear in map list and is ready for use. Admins running dedicated signed servers can grab server key from \keys folder. I recommend that you copy ALL of .pbo and .bisign files so that you can play on signed dedicated servers hosting Fapovo!

See install.txt in @fapovo folder for more info.
