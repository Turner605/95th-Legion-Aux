Official site: http://www.icebreakr.info/

1. INTRODUCTION
===============
Regero is a hommage map to OFP and Arma first series. Hopefully new players will appriciate it as the old fans.

2. AUTHOR
=========
IceBreakr is from Slovenia (Europe) and he's been a level designer for other games/simulations for more than 10 years now. Right after the release of Czech version of ArmA: Armed Assault, game soon became his passion and he formed a strong Slovenian community of mil-sim gamers supporting him in organizing and creating multiplayer coop/PvP events. Lack of islands made him switch to ArmA/ArmA 2 map making. Story continues in Arma 3.

3. WHAT IS REGERO?
====================
Kingdom with 3 provinces each trying to prevail.

4. CHANGELOG
============
For a complete list of changes see changelog.txt supplied in the archive. Includes history from first version in previous game engines.

5. FANTASY STORY TO GO ALONG WITH THE NEW ARMA ISLAND?
====================
Queen Zoe Nylund invited your PMC group to protect her weather station up near the Chatto river due to recent rebellion by the local population there. But it seems that is not a regular weather station or weather station at all. An incident in central ammo depot wiped out most of the fertile Regero's ground. Just as his dad, king of Regero, Leonard Nylund is approaching the San Isabel for the annual festival and parade, his helicopter is hit by the MANPAD missile. Believed on board is also to be Daniel, his son and brother to Zoe, the leader of Regero Army... chaos ensues with riots around the island as Zoe becomes the Queen of Regero... and your PMC team on her side to help her out.

6. INTERESTING FACTS
====================
Parco Apachia Mountains are done on real life filming location of Wings of Apache aka Firebirds movie ;)


7. INSTALLATION
===============
Warning: In order for this island to work you need a special package CUP Terrains Core (@cup_terrains_core) that includes legacy objects from previous Arma games!

Unpack folder \@regero to your ArmA3 root Steam folder and run game with -mod=@regero  parameter. Island will appear in map list and is ready for use. Admins running dedicated signed servers can grab server key from \keys folder. I recommend that you copy ALL of .pbo and .bisign files so that you can play on signed dedicated servers hosting regero!

See install.txt in @regero folder for more info.
